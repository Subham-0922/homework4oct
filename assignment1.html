        <h1> < b >  </h1>
        <p>The < b > HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance.
            <br> This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface.<br>
             However, you should not use < b > for styling text; instead, you should use the CSS font-weight property to create boldface text, or the < strong > element to indicate that text is of special importance.</p>
             <hr>
        <h1>< i ></h1>
        <p>The < i > HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations,<br> among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type,<br> which is the original source of the < i > naming of this element.</p>
        <hr>
        <h1>< u ></h1>
        <p>The < u> HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be altered using CSS.</p>
        <hr>
        <h1>< select ></h1>
        <p>The < select > HTML element represents a control that provides a menu of options.</p>
        <hr>
        <h1>< button></h1>
        <p>The < button> HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then performs a programmable action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog.</p><hr>
        <h1>< hr ></h1>
        <p>The < hr> HTML element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.</p><hr>
        <h1>< br ></h1>
        <p>The < br > HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.</p>
